# NFT-Peeper
Built using NextJS, React, and TypeScript, this web application allows users to view NFT's in Ethereum wallets by providing the wallet address. The OpenSea API and the npm web3 package were utilized to fetch and display NFT's from eth wallets. This project was styled using Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI.
